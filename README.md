# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL




This repository contains a Python script for advanced text summarization, by strategically combining traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with the power of the PEGASUS Transformer model.

Unlike traditional extractive summarization that merely picks sentences from the original text, this solution generates entirely new, concise, and fluent sentences that capture the core meaning of the input article.

Why This Approach?
Modern abstractive summarization, powered by large language models (LLMs), has revolutionized how we condense information. While models like PEGASUS are incredibly powerful on their own, integrating targeted traditional NLP steps can sometimes provide them with explicit signals, potentially leading to even more focused and relevant summaries.

This project combines:

Traditional NLP: For robust feature extraction, specifically identifying keywords (via TF-IDF) and named entities (via spaCy). These serve as explicit "hints" to the abstractive model about the article's most crucial elements.
PEGASUS Model: A state-of-the-art Transformer model pre-trained specifically for abstractive summarization. It excels at understanding the essence of text and generating novel, coherent summaries. By providing it with NLP-extracted context, we aim to guide its powerful generation process towards the most salient points.
Features
Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences for the summary, not just extracts.
PEGASUS Integration: Leverages google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail, a highly effective pre-trained model for summarization.
NLP Contextualization: Uses TF-IDF for keyword extraction and spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to enrich the input provided to PEGASUS.
Configurable Summary Length: Easily adjust max_length and min_length to control summary verbosity.
Beam Search Decoding: Utilizes beam search for higher quality and more diverse generated summaries.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the summarization script.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Installation
Clone the repository (or copy the code):

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-abstractive-summarization.git
cd advanced-abstractive-summarization
(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username if you're cloning this from your own repo, otherwise just copy the Python code into a .py file)

Install the necessary Python libraries:

Bash

pip install transformers scikit-learn nltk spacy
Download NLTK and spaCy models:
The script will attempt to download these automatically, but you can run them manually for a smoother first experience:

Bash

python -m nltk.downloader stopwords punkt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Usage
Run the Python script directly. The example article string within the if __name__ == "__main__": block can be replaced with your own text.
